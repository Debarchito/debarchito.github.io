> `d'DG` (pronounced `dis-dee-gee`) stands for **debarchito's** `Digital Garden`. This site is very recent, so expect some radical changes down the line!

### Who am I?

I'm **Debarchito Nath** (also known as `Andew`). I'm a computer science student who loves math a bit too much. I've been writing stories, poems, and other literary works for a fairly long time, but I've kept them to myself for the most part. But, its about time, I change that. Through `d'DG`, I plan to slowly but steadily share my creations with the world as well as create a unique digital place for myself. My socials (non-exhaustive):

- [GitHub](https://github.com/debarchito)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debarchito)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/739497344780992564)

### My works

- [[NightGarden]]  - A digital platform for sharing personal ideals and perspectives, fostering exploration and contemplation.
