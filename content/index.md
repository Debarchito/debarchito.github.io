### ðŸ¤” Who am I?

I'm **Debarchito Nath** (also known as `Andew`). I'm a computer science student who loves math a bit too much. I've been writing stories, poems, and other literary works for a fairly long time, but I've kept them to myself for the most part. But, its about time, I change that. Through `d'DG`, I plan to slowly but steadily share my creations with the world as well as create a unique digital place for myself. My socials (non-exhaustive):

- [GitHub](https://github.com/debarchito)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/739497344780992564)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/debarchito/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/debarchito)

### ðŸ““ My works..!

- [[Evergreen Shelf/Index|Evergreen Shelf]] - Collection of my literary works.
- [[Night Garden/Index|Night Garden]]  - An open diary sharing personal ideals and perspectives, fostering exploration and contemplation.
- [[The Andew Labs/Index|The Andew Labs]] - My tech blog.

### ðŸ”Ž Few things to note!

- When any page is edited, **the footnotes contain the latest revision date**. The original date of creation is preserved. This *doesn't* apply to **indexes** or **the landing page**, where the date only represents the latest revision.
- Bullet points are used in indexes when the amount of entries possible is predictable. Otherwise, numbers are used and sorted in reversed order (newer pages are on top).
