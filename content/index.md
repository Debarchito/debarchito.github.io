### Who am I?

I'm **Debarchito Nath** (also known as `Andew`). I'm a computer science student who loves math a bit too much. I've been writing stories, poems, and other literary works for a fairly long time, but I've kept them to myself for the most part. But, its about time, I change that. Through `d'DG`, I plan to slowly but steadily share my creations with the world as well as create a unique digital place for myself. My socials (non-exhaustive):
