Going forward, I'll be adding the [BRAINMADE.ORG](https://brainmade.org) logo to every work of mine, and the reasoning behind it is quite simple: 

> To be transparent about the usage of any kind of LLM-based tools, including LLM-powered auto-corrects and grammar correction.

Additionally, I will provide information on LLM's contribution in the creation, detailing the specific tasks they assisted with in the footer and ensuring full disclosure of their involvement. Steps like these are important to preserve the integrity of creative works, especially in the age of Generative AI.
