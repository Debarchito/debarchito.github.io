> One needs a place where they can wander freely through the corridors of thought, under the moon's gentle glow, exploring the depths of philosophy, the nuances and the intricacies of everyday life, all amidst the quiet embrace of the Night Garden. 

### ðŸŒ™ Riddles aside, what is it really about?

Night Garden is a place for me to speak my heart out about my ideals and takes on various topics. Its foremost a way to preserve my thoughts, reflections, and insights for myself and others to explore and contemplate. You are invited to step into this journey alongside me, where events unfurl for you to judge as we wander through the plains.
