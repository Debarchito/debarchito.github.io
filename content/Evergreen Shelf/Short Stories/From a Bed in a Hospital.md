**26th July,** Sunday. It was a hot summer day. The sun was overhead. Roads were full of wheels passing by; altogether, it was a busy time of the day. He was near an ice-cream shop; buying ice-cream for his sister. He walked towards the zebra crossing; waiting for the little light to glow. He was looking around while he spotted a homeless kitten; wandering, being ignored by everyone as if it had no existence. It looked that it went through a lot; which was no doubt the truth. It was hungry; he could say. He felt sorry for it and asked, “How can anyone treat something so adorable like it is nothing?”. He wanted to feed it something. But, it was crossing the road; still red. An ambulance was approaching at high speed. He rushed to rescue; throwing away everything he had in his hands. He pushed the kitten back. But… The ambulance struck him with great force. The windshield of the ambulance shattered. The stripes on the road turned red. The paramedic came out of the ambulance in a rush; kicking the kitten away as if it was a rock. His closing eyes saw it and questioned, “Why?”. They shouted, “Quick, quick! Load him in the ambulance!”. Civilians had different opinions. Someone said that he tried to suicide, while others said he was mad, but none of them bothered to think, “What if he was trying to save something?”. He closed his eyes; he was unconscious.

She saw everything. The vase she bought a few moments back, slipped from her hands; broken into pieces. She didn’t care. She ran for him screaming his name loud. “Open your eyes, open your eyes…”, she cried. “Miss, do you know this boy?”, the paramedic asked as if he didn’t know what happened. She replied in rage, “I saw everything! You were the one… You did…”. She caught his collar and said, “What have you done? What if anything happens to him?”. Everyone was looking at her. One of them said, “Calm down Miss! We will do everything to save him!”. She pushed the paramedic back. They loaded him in the broken ambulance. The paramedic couldn’t look in her eyes, as he knew that he had broken the speed limit even when there were no patients in the ambulance nor he was supposed to assist any at that moment; still not caring for a life while trying to save another life, doesn’t make any sense.

She rented a taxi and went for the hospital as there was no room left in that ambulance. After sometimes, he was inside the operation unit. Hours passed, and finally the report was in her hands. Her parents were present there as well. The report cleared that he was badly injured. He lost his ability to walk as he lost his legs; but he was still unconscious. She stayed by his side for the next 3 days. It was the night of the third day; she was sleeping by his side, resting her head on his bed. He slowly opened his eyes and said, “The kitten…” while raising his hands upwards. She woke up, rubbed her eyes and said, “Kai? Wait Kai!”. She shouted, “Mom! Dad! Kai is conscious, Kai is conscious!”. They rushed to see him. Her mother caught his hands and said, “Kai! Do you hear me?”. He said, “Mom, Dad, Sister…where is the kitten?”. She asked, “Kitten?”. He shouts, “Man! My leg hurts!”. She hugged him crying, “Don’t move! Don’t…you can’t walk anymore, you can’t…”. It was the first time he saw her cry. He looked towards his sister and asked, “Nika, why is mom saying so?”. He looked at his lower half. “Oh! I see”, said he, being calm. His sister hugged him saying, “Why are you such a reckless brother? What if I was not there? Why…”. She cried. He hugged her back and said, “I was trying to save a kitten”. She paused. “Kitten?”, she said. “So, were you able to save it?”, she asked. He replied with a smile, “Yes!”. “It was a homeless kitten; hungry. Everybody ignored it as if it had no existence. Everyone should understand, that it is not an object; life is precious. It reminded me the time when my parents passed away; way before I was adopted into this family. I had nowhere to go. Our house was taken down saying it was in the way of a construction project. I couldn’t defend it. ‘You are just a kid. Don’t interfere in our work’, they said. They took each and everything away from me that was the last memento of my parents. I ran away. I lied beside the road; nobody cared. Sometimes they kicked me saying I was in the way. So, I felt its pain; as I knew how it feels to be treated so ill. But my life changed. You all accepted me with whole hearts. I wanted the kitten to get someone who could love it. But today, if I didn’t do what I did, it could have never seen what good things life has to offer.”. Everyone went silent. His father patted his saying, “You did the right thing son. I am proud of you. Sometimes, we feel that we have no purpose in life. But this is not the truth; everyone has a purpose. We go through many difficult situations. Sometimes they break us so bad, we think we can’t recover. But then we find hope. How we find it, may vary, but a little fragment of hope can change our life forever. Today, you saved a life; which may look nothing more than a homeless kitten to others but you didn’t abandon it. So, what do you think? Should we add a new member to the family?”. He replied in joy, “Really? Then yes!”. “I don’t understand you at all. When did you become so mature?”, asked his sister. “What do you mean by that? Do you think I am still a small kid?”, said he. “That’s what you have always been!”, said his sister with a smile on her face. They all hugged each other.
